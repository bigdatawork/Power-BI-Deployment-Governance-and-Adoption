# Trainer information

Thank you for taking time to support the whiteboard design sessions as a trainer!

## Role of the trainer

An amazing trainer:

- Creates a safe environment in which learning can take place.

- Stimulates the participant's thinking.

- Involves the participant in the learning process.

- Manages the learning process (on time, on topic, and adjusting to benefit participants).

- Ensures individual participant accountability.

- Ties it all together for the participant.

- Provides insight and experience to the learning process.

- Effectively leads the whiteboard design session discussion.

- Monitors quality and appropriateness of participant deliverables.

- Effectively leads the feedback process.

## Whiteboard design session flow

Each whiteboard design session uses the following flow:

**Step 1: Review the customer case study (15 minutes)**

**Outcome**

Analyze your customer's needs.

- Customer's background, situation, needs and technical requirements

- Current customer infrastructure and architecture

- Potential issues, objectives and blockers

**Step 2: Design a proof of concept solution (120-180 minutes)**

**Outcome**

Design a solution and prepare to present the solution to the target customer audience in a 15-minute whiteboard format.

- Determine your target customer audience.

- Determine customer's business needs to address your solution.

- Design and diagram your solution.

- Prepare to present your solution.

**Step 3: Present the solution (30 minutes)**

**Outcome**

Present solution to your customer:

- Present solution

- Respond to customer objections

- Receive feedback

**Wrap-up (15 minutes)**

- Review preferred solution

## Before the whiteboard design session: How to prepare

Before conducting your first whiteboard design session:

- Read the Student guide (including the case study) and Trainer guide.

- Become familiar with all key points and activities.

- Plan the point you want to stress, which questions you want to drive, transitions, and be ready to answer questions.

- Prior to the whiteboard design session, discuss the case study to pick up more ideas.

- Make notes for later.

## During the whiteboard design session: Tips for an effective whiteboard design session

**Refer to the Trainer guide** to stay on track and observe the timings.

**Do not expect to memorize every detail** of the whiteboard design session.

When participants are doing activities, you can **look ahead to refresh your memory**.

- **Adjust activity and whiteboard design session pace** as needed to allow time for presenting, feedback, and sharing.

- **Add examples, points, and stories** from your own experience. Think about stories you can share that help you make your points clearly and effectively.

- **Consider creating a "parking lot"** to record issues or questions raised that are outside the scope of the whiteboard design session or can be answered later. Decide how you will address these issues, so you can acknowledge them without being derailed by them.

***Have fun**! Encourage participants to have fun and share!*

**Involve your participants**. Talk and share your knowledge but always involve your participants, even while you are the one speaking.

**Ask questions** and get them to share to fully involve your group in the learning process.

**Ask first**, whenever possible. Before launching into a topic, learn your audience's opinions about it and experiences with it. Asking first enables you to assess their level of knowledge and experience and leaves them more open to what you are presenting.

**Wait for responses**. If you ask a question such as, "What's your experience with (fill in the blank)?" then wait. Do not be afraid of a little silence. If you leap into the silence, your participants will feel you are not serious about involving them and will become passive. Give participants a chance to think, and if no one answers, patiently ask again. You will usually get a response.

# Power BI Deployment & Adoption Planning Workshop student guide

## Abstract and learning objectives

Contoso Healthcare care has some groups in their organization that started utilizing Power BI with some success particularly in providing dashboards to the Operations staff. They have added several television widescreen monitors that display the dashboards so everyone can quickly understand the current call volume, current tickets outstanding and many other metrics. Due to various individuals walking by the Operations department there have been many requests from other parts of the organization on to create the same kind of dashboards. The Emergency department subsequently has worked with IT and created their own dashboards that provide current wait times, scheduling, and call volumes. IT is getting more and more requests to provide additional Power BI reports after people hearing about and seeing the dashboards. But they dont have any ability to provide support or govern who has access to the data in the reports. 
Because of the ad-hoc requests to build reports with Power BI there are some questions starting to come up as to the value of some of the reports and also who should be maintaining and supporting them. Additionally, there are questions whether different parts of the organization would be able to self-service their report needs or even provide train the trainer courses. 
While the IT staff have a strong background in data they are limited in knowledge with controlling the proliferation of reports as they are being added in the organization. Currently, there are no plans to provide documentation or even best practices because the current implementations are very ad-hoc and narrow in scope. Because of the disparate facilitates providing access to that information should also be trimmed because smaller physician offices should not be able to see information about the main hospital or other physician offices. Because the healthcare industry is very focused on acquisitions the deployment needs to be setup as something that is reproducible and scalable so setting up the environment and policies around it are extremely important. 

## Step 1: Review the customer case study

**Outcome**

Analyze your customer's needs.

Timeframe: 15 minutes

Directions: With all participants in the session, the facilitator/SME presents an overview of the customer case study along with technical tips.

1.  Meet your table participants and trainer.

1.  Read all of the directions for steps 1-3 in the student guide.

1.  As a table team, review the following customer case study.

### Customer situation

Contoso Healthcare has been in their original location for 20 years and currently focused on expansion and acquisition. There are currently 10,000 employees that are in their Azure Active Directory and they currently have  20 satellite physician offices with a goal of more than doubling that number in the next 2 years. The satellite offices are unique because every office is an acquisition and they need to immediately begin using the parent organizations procedures and standards for quality care. So they need their existing data integrated as fast as possible.

Currently all patient information is stored on-premises because of the legacy systems. Most of the patient data is stored in AS-400 systems but there are batch jobs running hourly that are updating a SQL Server Data Warehouse for reporting purposes. They would like to continue to use their existing Data Warehouse as more satellite offices are added in the short term but also understand they need a cloud migration plan. There is an opportunity to start using cloud storage for data warehouse needs for newer offices as they are added. 

The current majority of reports are generate manually in Excel and PowerPoint and sent via email to hospital executives. Because of the volume, and manual processes, it is unsure whether everyone is submitting accurate or timely data. Additionally, it is impossible to recognize a trend because the reports are only assembled daily and weekly. Many of the reports are near identical in format and there are no aggregations of the reports.

No one has done an inventory & review of the current reports to see if which one are still required. There are a consistent stream of new requests for reports from internal, external, and regulatory requirements. It would great to put together a release strategy for new reports to justify the time and expense required and include any training required. Additionally, they would like to share best practices to not only existing users but a repository for new offices to utilize to learn how reports should be provided. 

Because of the scale there needs to be a support methodology that is available to the Operations team. Because of the many potential connections available they need a way to include information about potential system up-time and availability. Ideally either the Operations team or other parts of the organization can include the best practices as part of mentoring program. 

- Inventory data is stored in Azure SQL and updated with scanners in the warehouse and pharmacies
- No existing data governance. 
- No data archiving strategies

As part of its business plan, Contoso Healthcare is looking to implement the following objectives:
- Establish a culture of procuring and retrieving data in a repeatable format that does not require manual intervention.
- Work with out executive sponsors who want this project to succeed to ensure that every aspect of the project is run properly
- Work with the not only the enterprise but the various teams so they understand what reports they are responsible for creating and maintaining but also controlling who has access to them.
- Work with the teams to define a rollout out strategy to control the scope of the initial release to make it more successful.
- Create a governance council to not only be an escalation path to approve what data is available for reporting. Also define what groups have access to view the data. Additionally, this should include creating, maintaining and/or updating policies based on needs.
- Work with the operations teams to ensure that existing and new personnel have the training,mentoring, community, and documentation required so they can be self-sufficient.
- Because of the need to connect to cloud and on-prem data there needs to monitoring of these systems.

### Customer needs
1. Use existing on-premise data in the cloud reports
2. They would also like to minimize the operational overhead within their current processes.
3. They would like to have a release schedule as this gets implemented rather than a single launch. 
4. Provide a central repository of best practices, support questions and answers,  
5. Provide a plan for governing when new reports are needed and when they can be eliminated. 
6. An archiving strategy for existing reports 


### Customer objections
1. No migrations of existing data is in scope
2. Net new data storage can potentially stored in the cloud
3. How can we ensure HIPAA Compliance and also eliminate the potential for different offices from seeing each others information?

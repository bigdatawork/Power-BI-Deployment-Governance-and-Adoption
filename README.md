# Power BI Deployment, Governance, and Adoption

Contoso Healthcare, Inc., has been a healthcare provider for over 20 years. They originally started as a large hospital but now operate several Urgent Care facilities in addition to a dozen physician offices. The healthcare industry is constantly undergoing industry and regulation changes. Most of the software used is proprietary and forces disparate data repositories. 
Three of the concerns Contoso Healthcare is trying solve are controlling costs, maintaining patient quality of care, and meeting regulation requirements. Because of the size of the healthcare system it is difficult to ensure that healthcare providers that are part of the Contoso Healthcare system monitor hospital and healthcare quality indicators.

Contoso Healthcare needs the ability to collect and analyze data from within their systems in order to make the best uniform solution possible.
They want to provide better visibility to patient data, physician and nurse performance, medical population and stations. 

The improved ability to meet customer demand will be accomplished by establishing a 360-degree view of the supply chain. With data analysis and reporting, stores will be able to plan and schedule product deliveries based on customer sentiment and current buying trends.
